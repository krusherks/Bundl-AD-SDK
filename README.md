# Bundl-AD-SDK
Sample HTML Code showcasing the power of Bundl.ai's AD JS Snippet

Add the Script tag `<script src="https://bundl.ai/sdk/adsbybundl.js?query='summer%20dresses%20for%20women'"></script>` in your header


The query parameter in the JS link tells Bundl.ai what type of products to show on your website. 

Use `<bundl-listing></bundl-listing>` wherever you want the Bundl AD to show up in your website or mobile app!
